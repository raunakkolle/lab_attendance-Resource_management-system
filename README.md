Topic: Lab Attendance and Resource Management System
The Lab Attendance and Resource Management system manages the studentsâ€™ attendance in the
laboratory switching from the pre-existing manual entries to a digitalized automated registry of
the attendance. The attendance system will aid the department in calculating percentage and
generating reports for eligibility criteria of examination. The application system will provide a
flexible report for all students. Along with the management of attendance in the laboratory, this
system will also be used in the management of resources in the laboratory. Resource
Management includes addition or removal of resources, along with maintaining a record of
resource utilization.
